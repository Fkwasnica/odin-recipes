                <li>handful of halved cherry tomatoes</li>

            </ul>
        <h2><strong>How to make it</strong></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.</p> 
                    <p>Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.</p>
                    <p>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.</p>
                    <p>Cover with a tea towel and set aside.</p>
                    <p>You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.</p>
                    <p>Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong> if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.</p>
                    <p>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.</p>
                    <p>The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.</p>
                    <p>Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Top and bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.</p>
                    <p>Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf.</p>
                    <p>Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.</p>
                    <p>Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.</p>
                    <p>Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.</p>
                    <p>Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.</p>
                    <p>Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.</p>
                    <p>Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
                </li>
